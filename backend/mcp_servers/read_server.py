"""mcp_servers/read_server.py — WHOLE-APP MCP READ-only server for life-os (MCP-1).

External Claude Code connects over **stdio** and READS the user's life data across
ALL modules: finance/portfolio, market (+ TA indicators), projects, Claude-usage,
journals (trade + decision), the daily brief, the activity feed, the graveyard, the
OKX exchange overview, app settings, and the reliability report. It also exposes
``life_brief`` — ONE tool that composes the per-module reads into a single neutral,
source-tagged snapshot of the user's life (the agent data-layer, MCP-2), so an
external agent gets the whole picture in one call then reasons itself. The agent
synthesises + advises; this server writes NOTHING (writes, if ever, go through a
SEPARATE propose-style write-server — the wiki MCP split is the template).

THE CAPABILITY GATE (least-privilege, STRUCTURAL — not a flag):
This module imports ONLY read entry-points, each aliased with a leading underscore so
the bound names are obviously private wrappers:
  - finance:          get_overview, get_channel
  - market:           get_market, history, compute_indicators, tracked_assets,
                      candles, watchlist_data
                      (READ paths only — NOT poll_once / add_rule / delete_rule;
                      compute_indicators/candles/watchlist_data are the GET
                      /market/indicators //ohlc //watchlist read paths dev shipped —
                      WRAPPED, never edited; this file does NOT touch market/service.py
                      or market/ta.py, which dev owns. summarize() stays NEUTRAL.)
  - projects:         list_projects, get_project
  - graveyard:        get_graveyard
  - claude_usage:     get_usage
  - brief:            generate_brief, get_history     (generate ASSEMBLES from live
                      reads — it does NOT persist; save_brief is NOT imported)
  - journal:          list_entries
  - decision_journal: list_entries
  - activity:         get_feed, get_run
  - exchange:         get_overview                    (cached read; sync is internal +
                      not imported as a tool)
  - settings:         get_config                      (read; set_config NOT imported)
  - reliability:      run_suite                       (READ-ONLY suite — verifies
                      against an existing note, never writes)
  - macro:            get_overview, get_history        (Fed/CPI/DXY context, READ
                      paths only — NOT refresh / record_point / init_macro_tables,
                      which stay in WRITE_SYMBOLS. NEUTRAL: descriptive trend, no
                      forecast; mock honestly tagged source='mock'.)
  - agent proposals:  get_proposal, list_proposals, count_by_status (MCP-5 — the
                      agent READS the disposition of its OWN proposals to learn from
                      accept/reject. ONLY these 3 read fns are imported from
                      proposals_store — NOT enqueue / mark_decided / set_applied_ref /
                      append_audit, so the agent cannot write/decide via the read-
                      server; accept/reject stays human-only at the REST surface.)
It imports NO mutation symbol (create_/update_/delete_/upsert_/set_/add_/register_/
abandon_/restore_/refresh_/save_/poll_/sync/enqueue …). ``tests/test_mcp_read.py`` asserts
(a) no such symbol is bound in this module's namespace and (b) the AST of its imports
binds none of them — the gate proven by grep+AST, not by this docstring.

NO per-call audit table: unlike the wiki MCP (whose audit feeds the proposal-review
trust boundary), this is a pure read of single-user, no-auth local data — an audit
table would be over-engineering with no consumer. (life-os: simplest implementation,
full feature set. If a real audit need appears, add it then.)

Run:  python -m mcp_servers.read_server   (stdio; registered in Claude Code config)

NOTE: this module deliberately does NOT use ``from __future__ import annotations``.
FastMCP introspects each tool's parameter annotations at registration via
``issubclass(annotation, Context)`` — with stringized (future) annotations that call
raises ``TypeError: issubclass() arg 1 must be a class``. Real (non-string)
annotations are required for the SDK to build each tool schema. (Same constraint the
wiki MCP servers document.)
